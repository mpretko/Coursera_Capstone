Introduction / Business Problem

In this project, I will analyze how proximity to public transportation affects the success of businesses in a
major city.  For example, I will see how the ratings and number of likes of business venues depend on their
distance from the nearest subway station.  This information is crucial for people trying to open new businesses
in a city, who need to know the best location to set up their business.  Does proximity to public transportation
help or hurt businesses?  Does the answer depend on the particular type of business, or is it fairly universal?
And is this correlation strong enough to make access to public transportation an important factor in deciding
the location of a new business?  By analyzing location data and ratings metrics obtained from Foursquare, I will
produce actionable intelligence which will be highly valuable to prospective new businesses.


Data

For this project, I will require data about various business venues, as well as public transportation data.  
I have decided to focus on data from the city of Boston, where I lived for many years.  I will also focus on
metro (subway) data, since this is the primary means of public transportation in Boston.  Using Foursquare, I will
start by identifying all metro stations in the urban core of Boston.  I will then obtain data from a large sample
of business venues throughout the city, including both location data and various metrics of popularity, such as
ratings and number of likes.  Using the venue locations and the metro station locations, I will find the distance
from each venue to the nearest metro station.  I will then analyze my datasets to see what (if any) correlation
there is between success of a business and proximity to public transportation.  I will then use this information
to produce recommendations for people starting new businesses.
