# Coursera_Capstone
This is my capstone project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.  I first got warmed up using unsupervised machine learning to cluster neighborhoods of Toronto, using Foursquare data to find similar neighborhoods around the city.  This analysis can be found in the file Toronto_Neighborhood_analysis.ipynb, which uses the data Geospatial_Coordinates.csv.  My primary project, found in Capstone.ipynb, then undertakes an analysis on the effects of public transportation on businesses in urban areas.  I found that business success tends to decay exponentially with distance away from public transportation, indicating that this is a crucial factor in deciding the location of new businesses.  This analysis relies on the data found in ratings.csv.  I have summarized my findings in Report.pdf and Slides.pdf.
